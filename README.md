Unnecessary loops can lead to unintelligible code. It is therefore advisable to avoid them in all ways if possible. 
In our code, we have two functions doing the same thing but differently. The second one seems to flatten our list 
seamlessly, by use of function itertools.chain.
Comparing the two, the latter seems a better approach. 
Avoid unnecessary loops in all ways possible.
